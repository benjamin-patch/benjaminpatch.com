<h2>Choice Words</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> December 2016</li>
  <li><strong>Credits:</strong> Director and Writer</li>
  <li><strong>Runtime:</strong> 7 minutes 18 seconds</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> Without speaking a word, &quot;Choice Words&quot;
    stands as a metaphorical narrative exploring the sometimes difficult choices
    we all have to make throughout our lives.
    Thoughtful cinematic techniques are employed to express a simple but
    meaningful narrative that explores the conflict between personal desires and
    societal expectations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Production Notes:</strong> Benjamin Patch and his producing
    partner/wife, Leslie Patch recruited, organized, and lead a cast and crew of
    20 talented students and alumni of Binghamton University to produce this
    film.
    Of interesting note, the endless tunnel is a cinematic illusion.
    Instead of forking off endlessly in both directions,
    the shooting location has a wall behind the camera.
    Careful camera placement, editing, seamless CGI, and a mirrored image come
    together to create a space in the viewer's mind that in reality,
    does not exist.

<h2>Doppler Salad</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 2016</li>
  <li><strong>Credits:</strong> Cinematographer, Editor, Sound Designer</li>
  <li><strong>Runtime:</strong> 3 minutes 18 seconds</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> An exploration of color through the lens of
    fruits and vegetables!
    Note how colors increase their intensity as the objects drift by.
    Low frequency sounds are used with long wavelengths of warm reds and oranges
    while high frequency sounds are associated with short color wavelengths like
    blue and violet. 
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Production Notes:</strong> Meticulous lighting and set design
    coupled with a dolly system creates the illusion of objects floating in a
    black void.
    Color grading deepens the blacks and makes the colors more vivid.
    All sounds are added in post-production as a combination of ocean waves are
    mixed with more abstract synthesized sounds.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Iceland Montage</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> July 2016</li>
  <li><strong>Credits:</strong> Cinematographer and Editor</li>
  <li><strong>Runtime:</strong> 5 minutes 35 seconds</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> A montage of carefully composed shots from
    various locations around Iceland. This film is entirely nonverbal &ndash;
    the breathtaking landscapes and rhythmic editing to music speak best for
    themselves.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Production Notes:</strong> Much effort was taken to maximize the
    dynamic range of the Sony FS-100 camera that was used.
    Note how details from bright clouds as well as dark shadows are retained.
    Each shot was recorded using a narrow color profile (log-like)
    that was expanded in post-production to maximize the color reproduction
    from this 8-bit camera.
    The music is a series of pre-recorded loops precisely arranged to complement
    the visuals.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Shelf Space</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Release Date:</strong> May 2016</li>
  <li><strong>Credits:</strong> Director, Writer, Editor</li>
  <li><strong>Runtime:</strong> 4 minutes 33 seconds</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Synopsis:</strong> An evolutionary journey from the beginning of
    time to beyond the infinite.
    Inspired by Stanley Kubrick's <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>.
    Like Kubrick's iconic masterpiece, "Shelf Space" is open to numerous
    interpretations and meanings, which are left in the viewer's hands to
    create.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Production Notes:</strong> Writer/Director Benjamin Patch was
    searching for a simple way to construct a narrative spanning an immense
    period of time.
    “Shelf Space” employs lateral tracking shots and deliberate direction of
    movement to carry the viewer from the familiar,
    to beyond our current understanding of the universe.

  <li>
    <strong>Production Notes:</strong> The Sheriff's office is shot in front of

    Letus35 lens adapter, and a variety of macro lenses.
