Hi there, and thanks for visiting my artificial intelligence blog! My name is Benjamin Patch, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my technical skills and expand my knowledge. These articles are a way for me to share interesting things I’ve learned over the years. I hope you find them helpful.

I currently live in Southern California with my beautiful wife and playful dog. When I’m not programming or blogging, I write feature-length screenplays.

If you have any questions about my articles or would like to suggest future topics, please reach out to me [@benjaminpatch on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/benjaminpatch.bsky.social).
