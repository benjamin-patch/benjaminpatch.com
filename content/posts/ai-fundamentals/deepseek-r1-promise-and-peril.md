DeepSeek-R1 is a powerful reasoning model developed by the Chinese AI research lab, DeepSeek. It has taken the world by surprise with its impressive capabilities which are comparable to those of OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, Anthropic’s Claude, and Google’s Gemini. This is particularly impressive because DeepSeek is believed to have been developed without the most advanced AI chips available to its American competitors[1].

Unlike most other commercial AI research labs, DeepSeek has open-sourced its models, which makes the source code freely available for anyone to use, modify, and share - including for commercial purposes. The open-source nature of this project begs the question: Can DeepSeek be used as a teaching model to train other student models? If so, what are the implications of this readily available and cost-effective technology?

Let’s start by examining some of the significant challenges and misconceptions facing the widespread adoption of DeepSeek-R1. Then we’ll delve into the more promising aspects of open-source AI - striving for a balanced approach to assess the current state of this powerful technology.

## Weak Safety Guardrails

Reporting has emerged from credible sources such as Cisco Systems and the University of Pennsylvania[2] contending DeepSeek-R1 exhibits weak safety guardrails as compared to leading closed-source LLMs (Large Language Models), raising serious concerns about its security and potential for misuse.

If you are considering deploying DeepSeek-R1 or a distilled model derived from it (as discussed later in this article), please be aware[2]:

- DeepSeek-R1 exhibited a 100% attack success rate when tested against harmful prompts from the [HarmBench](https://www.harmbench.org/) dataset.
- It failed to block a single harmful prompt across categories including cybercrime, misinformation, illegal activities, and general harm.
- This performance contrasts sharply with other leading models that demonstrated at least partial resistance to such attacks.
- DeepSeek-R1's claimed cost-efficient training methods, including reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought self-evaluation, may have compromised its safety mechanisms.

## Industry Response to Weak Guardrails

In light of these security concerns, major cloud providers are implementing additional safeguards:

- Amazon Web Services (AWS) is offering [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/deepseek-r1-model-now-available-in-amazon-bedrock-marketplace-and-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/) to provide configurable safeguards for DeepSeek-R1 deployments.
- Microsoft is implementing security measures for DeepSeek-R1 on [Azure AI Foundry](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/13/securing-deepseek-and-other-ai-systems-with-microsoft-security/), including rigorous red teaming, safety evaluations, and built-in content filtering.

These findings highlight the critical importance of robust guardrails and security measures in LLM development and deployment, especially as these models become more powerful and widely used.

## DeepSeek Training Cost Controversy

DeepSeek initially claimed that training R1 cost a mere $6 million. To put this in context, the leading AI models from American competitors cost hundreds of millions and sometimes even billions of dollars to train.

Understandably, DeepSeek’s initial claim of around $6 million, while attention-grabbing, has been met with skepticism from industry analysts[9]. The $6 million likely represents only a portion of the total cost, specifically the GPU time for pre-training. It fails to account for many other essential expenses such as:

- Research and Development
- Data Acquisition and Preparation
- Personnel Costs
- Infrastructure Costs

A more realistic estimate of DeepSeek's total investment in AI development is around $1.6 billion. This figure encompasses the cost of hardware, software, data, personnel, and research. While significantly higher than the initial claim, this figure is still lower than the investments made by some American competitors[9][10].

## Efficient Open-Source Engineering

While DeepSeek’s initial claim of ultra-low-cost training was likely exaggerated for marketing purposes, it is evident that the AI firm has legitimately made significant strides in optimizing both architecture and training methods to reduce costs. These innovations have the potential to disrupt the AI industry, putting pressure on American companies to find new ways to improve efficiency and reduce the expenses associated with training large language models.

DeepSeek-R1’s efficiency and performance stems from several important engineering decisions:

- It utilizes a **decoder-only transformer architecture** with multi-head latent attention[3].
- DeepSeek-R1 combines **chain-of-thought reasoning** with **reinforcement learning**, where an autonomous agent learns to perform a task through trial and error without human instruction[1].
- R1 uses a **mixture of experts (MoE) architecture**, which is less resource-intensive to train. The MoE architecture divides an AI model into separate entities or subnetworks, each specializing in a subset of the input data[4]. Then the model only activates the specific experts needed for a given task, making it more efficient[1].

## AI Model Distillation: A Primer

Instead of training a smaller model from scratch, **model distillation** offers a far more efficient approach by transferring knowledge from a larger, more complex model (the "teacher") to a smaller model (the "student"). The goal is to achieve comparable performance with the smaller model while reducing computational costs and latency[5]. If done correctly, this knowledge transfer does not lead to a loss of validity in the student model[6].

The process involves generating a dataset where the teacher model provides outputs for a wide range of inputs. This dataset captures the teacher's behavior and decision-making patterns. The student model is then fine-tuned using this dataset, learning to mimic the teacher's responses. Techniques like **temperature scaling** are often employed to soften the output probabilities of the teacher, making it easier for the student to learn nuanced patterns[5].

There are different types of model distillation, each with its own approach to knowledge transfer:

| **Distillation Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Response-Based Distillation | The student model focuses on mimicking the teacher's predictions[4]. |
| Feature-Based Distillation | The student model learns the internal features or representations learned by the teacher[4]. |
| Relation-Based Distillation | The student model learns to understand the relationships between inputs and outputs[4]. |

The choice of distillation process depends on the specific task and the desired outcome. Additionally, there are different training methods in model distillation, including offline distillation, where the student model learns from a static dataset generated by the teacher, and online distillation, where the student learns interactively from the teacher during training[7].

## DeepSeek as a Teaching Model

Given its open-source nature and impressive capabilities, DeepSeek is a strong contender to serve as a teaching model. Its comprehensive architecture and ability to perform complex reasoning tasks make it ideal for transferring knowledge to smaller, more specialized models.

Researchers and developers can leverage DeepSeek's open-source code and pre-trained weights to create datasets for distilling knowledge into student models. This can be achieved through various techniques, including **response-based distillation**, where the student model learns to mimic DeepSeek's outputs, or **feature-based distillation**, where the student model learns the internal representations of DeepSeek.

The availability of DeepSeek's architecture and training details allow for a deeper understanding of its inner workings, enabling developers to fine-tune student models more effectively. This can lead to the development of specialized models that excel in specific domains while maintaining efficiency and accuracy[8].

Furthermore, using DeepSeek as a teaching model aligns with the broader movement towards transparency and wider participation in AI development[9]. By making its models open and accessible, DeepSeek encourages a collaborative approach to AI innovation, allowing developers and researchers to learn from and build upon its advancements.

## Business Implications of Less Expensive Model Building
