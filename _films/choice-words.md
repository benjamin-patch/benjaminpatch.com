**Synopsis:** Without speaking a word, "Choice Words" stands as a metaphorical
narrative exploring the sometimes difficult choices we all have to make
throughout our lives. Thoughtful cinematic techniques are employed to express a
simple but meaningful narrative that explores the conflict between personal
desires and societal expectations.

**Production Notes:** Benjamin Patch and his producing partner/wife, Leslie
Patch recruited, organized, and lead a cast and crew of 20 talented students and
alumni of Binghamton University to produce this film.

Of interesting note, the endless tunnel is a cinematic illusion. Instead of
forking off endlessly in both directions, the shooting location has a wall
behind the camera. Careful camera placement, editing, seamless CGI, and a
mirrored image come together to create a space in the viewer's mind that in
reality, does not exist.
