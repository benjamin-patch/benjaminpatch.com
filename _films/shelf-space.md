**Synopsis:** An evolutionary journey from the beginning of time to beyond the
infinite. Inspired by Stanley Kubrick's _2001: A Space Odyssey_. Like Kubrick's
iconic masterpiece, "Shelf Space" is open to numerous interpretations and
meanings, which are left in the viewer's hands to create.

**Production Notes:** Writer/Director Benjamin Patch was searching for a simple
way to construct a narrative spanning an immense period of time. “Shelf Space”
employs lateral tracking shots and deliberate direction of movement to carry the
viewer from the familiar, to beyond our current understanding of the universe.
