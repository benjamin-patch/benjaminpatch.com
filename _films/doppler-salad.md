**Synopsis:** An exploration of color through the lens of fruits and vegetables!
Note how colors increase their intensity as the objects drift by. Low frequency
sounds are used with long wavelengths of warm reds and oranges while high
frequency sounds are associated with short color wavelengths like blue and
violet.

**Production Notes:** Meticulous lighting and set design coupled with a dolly
system creates the illusion of objects floating in a black void. Color grading
deepens the blacks and makes the colors more vivid. All sounds are added in
post-production as a combination of ocean waves are mixed with more abstract
synthesized sounds.
