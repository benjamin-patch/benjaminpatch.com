**Synopsis:** A montage of carefully composed shots from various locations
around Iceland. This film is entirely nonverbal â€“ the breathtaking landscapes
and rhythmic editing to music speak best for themselves.

**Production Notes:** Much effort was taken to maximize the dynamic range of the
camera. Note how details from bright clouds as well as dark shadows are
retained. Each shot was recorded using a narrow color profile that was expanded
in post-production. The music is a series of pre-recorded loops precisely
arranged to complement the visuals.
