**Synopsis:** This short experimental-narrative film is a composite of
stop-motion animation and computer-generated imagery (CGI). The characters and
sets are physical Lego toys shot with careful lighting and macro lenses while
the atmospheric effects are CGI.

**Production Notes:** The Sheriff's office is shot in front of a green-screen
that was later replaced with the final background. As with most animated films,
voices were recorded and edited first for overall timing. All other sounds were
added only after the visuals were complete. This film was shot with a Panasonic
AG-DVX100 (DVCPRO HD), Letus35 lens adapter, and a variety of macro lenses.
