**Synopsis:** This fun, light-hearted comedy centers around Herby Laxx who is
haunted by an alarm clock that refuses to leave him alone.

**Production Notes:** Shot on standard definition digital video (miniDV) with no
professional lights or dollies. Gorilla shooting methods were extensively
employed to create the end result. Most sound was recorded on location but
several sequences were replaced or enhanced with folly work during post. The
score was mixed from a music library.
